    "review": "The necklaces I purchased were even more beautiful than the photo. The artist communicated with me very effectively and even sent the items before I was expecting. One of a kind , beautiful work that my partner and I will love for years to come. I'd also like to add that the artist lives in California and there are wildfires going on in the west coast right now but he still managed to make these beautiful works of art with a natural disaster and pandemic plaguing our country. Will definitely purchase from again without a doubt.",

    "review": "Product: I got the long ear hooks. Adam included simple clear stoppers to keep the earrings from falling out, but I find that I don't really need them for the long hooks. The craftsmanship is really nice, and these have already become an 'everyday wear' earring for me. I also wore them to a sort of shi-shi party over the weekend and got quite a few compliments on them. I'll likely be ordering the brass sun style later :)\r\n\r\nShipping and handling: The earrings came super fast in a nice little black box inside a padded envelope. Everything was all in one piece and looked really sharp.",
