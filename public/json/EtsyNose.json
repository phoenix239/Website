I don't have a nose model... But you can purchase them as earrings!! (See my other listings)","","","","NOTE: Due to this item being handmade, minor differences (from pictured) in color and texture will exist. I strive to keep them consistent, but minor variations do happen.","","","----- A Note on Lab Created Stones -----","","This is NOT a simulated stone (aka red/clear glass)","   ","- How they’re made:","","The mineral composition of lab-created stones is created through a process similar to what nature does beneath the earth over millions of years, but in a lab at a fraction of the time, and for a fraction of the cost of mining.","","The average person would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between a natural and lab-created stone. It takes a trained eye, high magnification and other instruments.","","The main distinction is natural gems typically have inclusions from the crystallization process — gases and other minerals mixing during the molten stage of stone creation. Because lab-created stones rely on a steady, controlled process of applying minerals, heat and pressure, they usually have fewer inclusions.","","So you get high-quality lab-created stones, and their prices are significantly lower than their natural gemstone counterparts. ","","- Other considerations:","","In addition to getting a rare, top-quality fine gemstone look for less, many consumers are attracted to lab-created stones for other reasons. Environmentally speaking, lab-created stones do not tax natural resources the way the process for natural gems does — no mines are dug, the labs use a fraction of the utilities and resources necessary for a mining operation and leave behind less pollutants."],"state":"active","creationDate":1602388866,"modifiedDate":1644903622,"stateTimestamp":1639657410,"quantity":3,"url":"https://www.etsy.com/listing/885005191/2mm-stone-nose-stud-customizable-more","tags":["minimalist","Nose Stud","Simple Stud","Metalwork fabricated"],"materials":["Silver"],"processingMin":5,"processingMax":15,"hasVariations":true,"price":{"amount":25,"currency":"USD"},"images":[{"rank":1,"imageUrl75x75":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/c/2666/2119/125/319/il/5cc045/2849141588/il_75x75.2849141588_7ckt.jpg","imageUrl170x135":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/c/2666/2119/125/319/il/5cc045/2849141588/il_170x135.2849141588_7ckt.jpg","imageUrl570xN":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/5cc045/2849141588/il_570xN.2849141588_7ckt.jpg","imageUrlFullxFull":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/5cc045/2849141588/il_fullxfull.2849141588_7ckt.jpg","fullHeight":2772,"fullWidth":2880},{"rank":2,"imageUrl75x75":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/c/1630/1295/634/919/il/6ef6a6/2630069389/il_75x75.2630069389_39re.jpg","imageUrl170x135":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/c/1630/1295/634/919/il/6ef6a6/2630069389/il_170x135.2630069389_39re.jpg","imageUrl570xN":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/6ef6a6/2630069389/il_570xN.2630069389_39re.jpg","imageUrlFullxFull":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/6ef6a6/2630069389/il_fullxfull.2630069389_39re.jpg","fullHeight":3000,"fullWidth":3000},{"rank":3,"imageUrl75x75":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/4666d8/2582391408/il_75x75.2582391408_cdk7.jpg","imageUrl170x135":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/4666d8/2582391408/il_170x135.2582391408_cdk7.jpg","imageUrl570xN":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/4666d8/2582391408/il_570xN.2582391408_cdk7.jpg","imageUrlFullxFull":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/4666d8/2582391408/il_fullxfull.2582391408_cdk7.jpg","fullHeight":2209,"fullWidth":2209},{"rank":4,"imageUrl75x75":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/bec2a7/2582391476/il_75x75.2582391476_cg5t.jpg","imageUrl170x135":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/bec2a7/2582391476/il_170x135.2582391476_cg5t.jpg","imageUrl570xN":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/bec2a7/2582391476/il_570xN.2582391476_cg5t.jpg","imageUrlFullxFull":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/bec2a7/2582391476/il_fullxfull.2582391476_cg5t.jpg","fullHeight":3000,"fullWidth":3000},{"rank":5,"imageUrl75x75":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/f8fdaa/2630056617/il_75x75.2630056617_tile.jpg","imageUrl170x135":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/f8fdaa/2630056617/il_170x135.2630056617_tile.jpg","imageUrl570xN":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/f8fdaa/2630056617/il_570xN.2630056617_tile.jpg","imageUrlFullxFull":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/f8fdaa/2630056617/il_fullxfull.2630056617_tile.jpg","fullHeight":3000,"fullWidth":3000},{"rank":6,"imageUrl75x75":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/b6c9ce/2582391556/il_75x75.2582391556_oz84.jpg","imageUrl170x135":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/b6c9ce/2582391556/il_170x135.2582391556_oz84.jpg","imageUrl570xN":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/b6c9ce/2582391556/il_570xN.2582391556_oz84.jpg","imageUrlFullxFull":"https://i.etsystatic.com/20692514/r/il/b6c9ce/2582391556/il_fullxfull.2582391556_oz84.jpg","fullHeight":3000,"fullWidth":3000}]}]
